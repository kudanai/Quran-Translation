# Quran Translation Maintenance Project

This is a collaborative effort to keep the digitized version of the [Dhivehi Translation of the Noble Quran by Office of the President of Maldives](https://presidency.gov.mv/quran), up-to-date and error free. This version is currently used by [Tanzil.net](https://tanzil.net/#trans/dv.divehi/1:1), [Quran.com](https://quran.com/1), [Quran for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.quran.labs.androidquran&hl=en), [Tarteel.ai](https://www.tarteel.ai), [Al Quran (gtaf)](https://gtaf.org/apps/quran/), [Quranly](https://www.quranly.app) and [Quran.mv](https://quran.mv) among others.

Before committing changes, please read the project guidelines carefully.

## Project Guidelines

* The project's aim is to produce a digital copy word-for-word and therefore, you must NOT add your own interpretations, opinions etc. Basically, if it's not in the official translation, don't think about it.

* The alternate `alt_dv.divehi.txt` file contains transliterated arabic words. Do NOT mix up the two branches.

* While we recognize that there have been debates about the quality of the translation and disagreements among some scholars, it is NOT the concern of this project to correct them at this time. However, contributors may correct typing errors.

* NEVER ADD OR REMOVE ROWS from the file. This is **VERY IMPORTANT**

* Only use unicode input methods to enter text. This means you must change your text entry language to "Dhivehi" while typing dhivehi, and to "Arabic" while typing Arabic. (You may need to setup your system to allow this. Go to regional settings and add keyboad layout)

* Use a reliable text-editor that supports unicode, and edit in plain-text mode only (don't introduce rich-text markups, BOM's etc…)
